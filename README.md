<h2>Results:</h2>
<p>The analysis showed that rural cities had the highest average fare per driver and ride while urban cities had the lowest. The high fares observed in rural cities were due to the low number of total rides and total drivers in those cities.</p>
<p>The multiple line graph showed that urban cities had the highest total fare within the months of January to April 2019, followed by rural cities while suburban cities had the lowest fare. The low fares observed in suburban cities and the drop in the number of ride usage in rural cities within the months of January to April 2019 could be due to the low number of available rides and drivers in those cities. Allocating more rides and drivers to these cities will most likely reduce average fare per ride and driver, which will boost ride affordability. In addition, providing more rides to urban cities within the months of January to April will help meet the demand for rides in those months, increase revenue, and enhance affordability.</p>

<h2>Recommendation(s):</h2>
<p>In addition to the above analysis, obtaining more information about the demographics of those living in the three city types and additional two to five previous year city and ride data is recommended. With demographic information such as population and age range, we can group the fares by age and city type or by population and city type. This information will shed more light on the reasons why some of the city types had high average fare per driver and ride.</p>

<h2>Recommended Future Analysis:</h2>
<p>Further analysis can be done on the impact of surge pricing on the total fares and ride usage within the months of January to April. Additionally, analyzing the ride sharing data by time of day and day of the week will provide insights into the peak hours for ride usage in each city type, which can help optimize the allocation of rides.</p>
